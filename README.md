# Decision Maker on React Native Web
_A semi-automatic random picking decision maker built with react-native-web_
<br /><h3>**[Demo](https://decisionmaker-rnw.netlify.com/)**</h3>
## How-To
1. Type your question which needs to be decided.
2. Select the type and contents of the options you'd like
3. Click the 'Ready' button and the wheel selector pops up
4. You manually scroll the wheel with touch/dragging/scrolling
5. Click 'OK' on the upper right hand of the pop-up

## Used NPM Libraries
1. [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
2. [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)
3. [rmc-picker](https://github.com/react-component/m-picker)

<br /><br />
_I made some lines of m-picker(rmc-picker) library files to fit into my design of application, so it might not exactly same looking when you use the original version of these libraries, so that the mouse scrolling also works along with the original drag-to-select._<br /><br />
